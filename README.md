# ammar daskin - Data Mining
Monday 8:30pm on zoom & K401

You are expected to have prior programming experience, basic understanding of data structure, algorithms, linear algebra, probability and statistics. 

This course introduces students to the concepts of data science and algorithms used in data mining. The course starts with the introduction to data libraries used in Python such as numpy and pandas. Then, it discusses algorithms and concepts used in data mining  such as classification, regression, clustering,  anomaly detection,  association analysis, graph analysis: ranking.  Examples are done using scikit-learn and other data analysis packages.
